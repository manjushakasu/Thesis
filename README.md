Agent Based Modeling of 3D Network on Chip

Description:

This 3D Agent Based Model is created with intelligent and autonomous software agents (designed in Java).
These Intelligent agents are coded in java which behaves in certain way and follow specific rules. Apart
from the model itself, a routing algorithm is also implemented using self directive agents. 

This 3D NoC model is an application which is designed to run on MASON, a multi-agent simulation toolkit (http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/ ). 

In order to implement the 3D model, I have used Mason multi-agent simulation library core written in Java and also Java class libraries such as JFreeChat and itext. Java API such as JMF and Java3D. 

Implementation:

This application is designed to run on "Mason multi-agent simulation tookit".
To check the classes created by me, visit the package named "noc3D" which is located at "/src/sim/app/noc3D".
In order to run the application please set up the environment in your local device.
Instuctions for the setup are given in file "Readme_To_Run_3D_NoC_Model".
